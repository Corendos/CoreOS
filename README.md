# CoreOS
Embedded OS for ARM

## Introduction
This project is a project that I started back in 2016 during my first year at CentraleSup√©lec. I wanted to know more about Operating Systems and I started to write a very basic kernel from various sources from scratch.

I had to stop for various reasons, but the code was running fine on RPi 0 when I stopped.

Currently, the raspberry boots, print some characters to the UART and then loops by sending back everything it receives on the UART.
